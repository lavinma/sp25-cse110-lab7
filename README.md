### Check Your Understanding
1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
   Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed...
   I would do this because tests would be run automatically everytime code is pushed to the repository. It would be a part of a continuous integration (CI) workflow, so bugs would be caught earlier and attempting to merge broken code wouldn't happen. With this approach, as a developer, I would not have to remember to run these tests and the codebase will still remain stable.
